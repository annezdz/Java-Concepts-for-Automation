    /*
    * WebDriver - class - click, sendkeys, getTitle
    * We are using the same method for Firefox, Safari, Chrome, etc
    * Abstract is a special keyword used ad a non-access modifiers with classes and methods
    * If Abstract is used with class then no one can instantiate
    * that class and these classes are known as abstract classes
    *
    * If abstract is used with ethod then it must be overridden in first concrete class
    *
    * Abstract Class X Concrete Class
    *
    * The classes which  cannot be instatiated are known as Abstract class
    * Concrete class are those classes which can be instantiated
    *
    *
    * The abstract method is that method which doesnt contaisn any body and must be overridden in first concrete class
    *
    * Properties: abstract class should always use the keyword 'abstract' and in declaration it must be without body
    * The class of abstract method must be an abstract class. Abstract method cannot be declare in a concrete class.
    * The abstract method must be overridden by first concrete class which extends the abstract class
    *
    * In a Abstract class some methods can be concrete, but in a interface ALL methods are abstracts
    * No exemplo em que usamos a classe WebDriver e FirefoxDriver, o método que NÃO é abstrato não é implementado;
