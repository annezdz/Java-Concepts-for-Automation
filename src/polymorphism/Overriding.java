    * Can we change return type while performing overriding ?
    * NO - when the return types are primitive (boolean, byte, char, int, long double, etc)
    * YES - when case the return types are className (COVARIANT)
    *
    * covariant - the return types are className and there is parent - child relationship between those classes
    *
    * int - Integer
    * double - Double
